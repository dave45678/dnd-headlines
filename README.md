# Android Basics Nanodegree Project #8 - Build a News Listing App
PROMPT: Create a News feed app which gives a user regularly
updated news from the internet related to a particular topic,
person, or location.

The app will fetch data via an HTTP request of the News API and 
parse the JSON response data to display the top news/headlines
based on a certain news source (either default or user's
preference).
